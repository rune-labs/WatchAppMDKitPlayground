This uses the same bundle id as the main PD app, so running this on your device will overwrite the strive app there if you have it installed, you should uninstall first.

Don't change the bundle id's because you have to request permission from Apple on a per-appid basis, and we don't have one of these for testing so this app has to be the main app as far as provisioning goes.
